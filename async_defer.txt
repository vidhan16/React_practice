In normal script tag,
<script>  ->
The HTML file will be parsed until the script file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file.
The script then gets executed before parsing is resumed.

<script async>  ->
async downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.

<script defer>  ->
defer downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed.
defer scripts are also guranteed to execute in the order they appear in the document.
